    <td>The first task was to create a new repository. This was  very simple and straightforward and easy to understand as we had done this twice in the past in Years 7 and 8.  We had to  create a  new blog  and change the layout of the new website which we would be handed in the Mr Keen next lesson. Although, I had come across this in the past,  I was a little unsure on as what to do.  Just in time Mr Keen reminded us of the DCGS RESOURCES WEBSITE which had useful tips on creating blogs and other coding.</td>

    <td>Today there weren't many distractions and I was able to focus really easily.  The only problem that got in my way was the fact that I was stuck on what to do for a good part of the lesson. I asked people around me but the were also stuck.</td>
